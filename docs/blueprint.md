## Core Features:

- Data Entry Form: Display a digital form for sales agents to input stock data.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Navy blue (#3B5998) to convey trust, stability, and professionalism, as this app manages important stock data.
- Background color: Light gray (#F0F4F8) for a clean and neutral backdrop, allowing the data to stand out.  It should be visually related to the blue, as though 'blue with white added'.
- Accent color: Sky blue (#87CEEB) as a lighter accent, for interactive elements like buttons, to guide the user, without clashing with the darker background and primary color.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter', a sans-serif font, providing a clean, modern, neutral look to present data clearly.
- Implement a clear and structured layout with consistent spacing to ensure readability.
- Use minimalist icons to represent different stock parameters. They should visually harmonize with the typography and general simplicity of the layout.
